# Task4 Sparks Foundation (EDA Terrorism)
## Overview
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of terrorism-related datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The goal is to analyze the impact of terrorism, examine the geographical distribution of incidents, and explore various factors contributing to terrorism events.

## Objective
- Perform EDA on a dataset containing information about terrorist attacks.
- Analyze and visualize trends related to terrorism incidents over time.
- Identify hotspots of terrorism activities based on regions and countries.
- Understand the impact of various factors (e.g., attack type, region, time) on terrorism.

##Tools & Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Libraries:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Jupyter Notebook: For creating and running the analysis interactively.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes information about various terrorist attacks around the world, including:
- Country
- Date of attack
- Attack type
- Number of casualties
- Region
- Group responsible, and more.

## Steps Involved
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
- Data Transformation: Converting data into suitable formats for analysis.
- Visualization: Generating plots to visualize the distribution of attacks across different dimensions (time, location, type).
- Insight Generation: Identifying patterns and drawing conclusions from the data.

## Project Highlights
- A comprehensive analysis of the impact of terrorism by region and year.
- Identification of top countries affected by terrorism.
- Visualization of terrorist attack patterns over time.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
- Install necessary libraries using:
    - pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
- Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the EDA and visualize the results.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the patterns of terrorism and can aid in understanding the global impact of terrorism over time.
